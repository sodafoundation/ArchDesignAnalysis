## **SWIFT OPENSTACK

## WHAT IS SWIFT?

 
**OpenStack Swift, also known as OpenStack Object Storage, it is a  
    open source  software designed to manage the storage of large
    amounts of data cost-effectively on a long-term basis across
    clusters of standard server hardware OpenStack Swift software is
    based on Cloud Files technology developed by Rackspace Hosting Inc 
    OpenStack includes compute, storage and networking components for
    building cloud computing services.  Common use cases for OpenStack
    Swift include the storage, backup and archiving of unstructured
    data, such as documents, static web content, images, video files,
    email and virtual machine images.**

## HOW IT WORKS

 **OpenStack Swift stores data as binary objects on the server operating 
 system's underlying file system. Each object has associated metadata  
 as part of the extended attributes of the file   The Swift software   
 supports replication and erasure coding across the storage nodes in   
 the server cluster. Swift places copies of every object in locations  
 that are unique as possible  first by region, then by zone, server   
 and drive. If a server or hard drive fails, OpenStack Object Storage  
 replicates its content from active nodes to new locations in the   
 cluster**

## STORAGE DEVICE

 

**The   object storage system scales horizontally to store
       petabytes of data through the addition of server nodes, which can
       be equipped with hard disk drives or solid-state drives 
       OpenStack Swift uses a ring to map the object storage data to
       server partitions. The system uses a separate ring for services
       such as account, object and container. A ring builder constructs
       and manages the rings, assigns partitions to the storage devices,
       and pushes configuration information to the storage nodes.**

# Features of open stack swift*

 **It works on storage capabilities, drivers and bug fixes designed to improve the performance, stability, reliability, scalability and usability of the object storage software.
 Many project team members are employees of technology vendors that sell products based on OpenStack Object Storage or the Swift API. 
The OpenStack Swift project team releases a major update twice a year, as do the teams that support other OpenStack projects.**
